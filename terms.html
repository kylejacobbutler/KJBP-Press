<p>As such, the User ensures that the User Content complies with all legal provisions applicable. The User refrains from publishing any User Content on the Website that s/he is not the author of or for which s/he does not hold the rights required to use this content on the Website.</p><br>
<strong>The Company prohibits the publication of any document that, in particular, contains:<br>
* statements that are slanderous, defamatory, infringe privacy, advertising or any third-party right;<br>
* viruses, spyware, adware, worms or any other malicious code, content or file that provide access to <br>illegal content outside the Website or that automatically lead to such access.</strong><br>
<p>
The User is solely liable for any damage caused by her/his Publications, in particular when they are published online in such a manner that they infringe the General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Service hereof.</p>

<p>
The User unconditionally agrees that the Company, in its sole discretion, may, if necessary, modify the Website or delete or remove (without any notice) any Website Content or any User Content that it deems an infringement of the General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Service hereof, as well as any User Content that may be offensive, illegal or liable to infringe the rights of users of the Service or third parties, or that may be a threat to the safety of Service Users, third parties or may prejudice or harm.
By publishing a Publication on the Website, the User explicitly grants a right of use of the User Content to the Company, which enables the Company to create copies required for publishing and storing the User Content on the Website.

<h1 id="user-obligations"> User Obligations</h1>
The provision of the KJBP PRESS Website Service begins when the Account is opened, regardless of the type of subscription or of Account chosen by the User. The Website User has no right of withdrawal, pursuant to Article L.121-20-0 of the French Consumer Code.
Regardless of the type of subscription chosen, the KJBP PRESS Website User agrees to make reasonable use of the Website and software or applications made available to her/him on the Website pursuant to the General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Service hereof.
Misuse of the KJBP PRESS Service is prohibited in any form whatsoever.
KJBP PRESS, in particular, formally prohibits the User from (without this list being exhaustive):

* Damaging, in any way or by any means, the integrity of the Website and the Service, the property rights of the website or of other Users;
* Renting, selling, reselling, licensing or distributing licenses provided by the website for services or any Service content;
* Using the Website and/or the Service for spamming purposes, email bombing, abusive emailing campaigns, abusive SEO, infringement of authors’ rights, related rights, copyrights, publication of slanderous, defamatory, violent, sexually explicit content or content that incites racial hatred.
* Modifying or altering any part of the Website or Service (including, in particular, the KJBP PRESS reader and related technologies)
* Accessing contents available on the Website (including the website Content, as defined above) using means or technology other than the pages and reading tools available on the Website itself, the KJBP PRESS reader and any other means that the Company may make explicitly available for this purpose;
* Attempting to or actually bypassing, deactivating or destabilizing, in any way or by any means, any security-related function of the Website (i) preventing or restricting the use or copy of contributions made by users of the Website or of the Website Content itself or (ii) imposing limitations on the use of the Website or on the Content accessible on the Website;
* Attempting to or actually decomposing, decompiling or tapping into all or part of KJBP PRESS source code, the source code of the Website, of the reader or of any other tool proposed by KJBP PRESS on its Website.

Furthermore, the User undertakes not to use or launch an automated system (including, in particular, any robot, spider or reader offline that may access the Website) that sends more query messages to the Company's servers over a given period of time that could not be reasonably produced by a human over the same period of time using a standard Internet browser (i.e. a non-modified one) available to the public. Notwithstanding the aforementioned, the Company grants public search engine administrators the authorization to use spiders to copy items from the Website exclusively for indexing these items for public viewing, but not to copy caches or archives of these items. The Company reserves the right to revoke these exceptions in a general way or case by case.
The User who opens an Account for a community, association, organization, group or company declares that s/he holds the proxy required to do so.
The User is solely liable for the use that s/he makes of hyperlinks that direct to third-party websites and content and that are available on the Website or in User Content that s/he views.
The User agrees to be bound by YouTube's Terms of Service when making use of videos from YouTube available on the Website or in User Content.
The User is solely liable for any damage caused to the Service, to the Company or to any third party as a result of unauthorized use of the Website from her/his Account.
In the event of disregard to her/his obligations, provided for under applicable laws and the General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Service hereof, KJBP PRESS reserves the right to suspend the User’s account as well as access to his/her publications indefinitely and will inform the User of this suspension by email. KJBP PRESS also reserves the right to implement any technical or legal measure required to prevent a User, who disregards the General Terms and Conditions of Sale and Service hereof, from accessing the Service. In this respect, KJBP PRESS will keep the sums paid by the User and undertakes not to claim further payment before the end of the Account suspension period.
